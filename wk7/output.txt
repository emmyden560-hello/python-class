Executive Summary  
This comprehensive report presents the ﬁndings from the endline evaluation of the 
Debbie Kauna Foundation project supported by UN Women  through  the National 
Humanitarian Fund  (NHF), focusing on advancing the economic and social 
empowerment of persons living with disabilities (PLWDs)  across 8 communities in 
Michika and Madagali LGAs of Adamawa state Nigeria. W ith a special focus on women 
who constitute 98% of participants. The evaluation sampled 256 beneﬁciaries to gauge 
outcomes across multiple dimensions, including mentorship effectiveness, vocational 
skill acquisition, ﬁnancial inclusion, digital literacy, and gender -based violence (GBV) 
awareness.  
The data reveal that participants beneﬁted greatly from mentorship initiatives, which equipped them with critical business skills, increased their conﬁdence, and enhanced 
their ability to navigate challenges. Vocational training empowered them to engage in various value chains such as Animal Husbandry, Tailoring, Shoe Making, and Tie & Dye, 
helping many starts or expand income -generating businesses.  
However, the evaluation also highlights several key constraints, notably limited access to 
capital, equipment, and essential animal health services that restrict business growth. 
Digital literacy remains an area for improvement, coupled with enhancing acce ss to 
devices, while GBV awareness and support mechanisms need stronger integration.  
Despite these gaps, participants report increased well -being and feel a greater sense of 
inclusion and respect within their communities, underscoring the project's positive 
impact on both livelihoods and social cohesion. The report concludes with practical  
recommendations to ensure sustainability and scale, emphasizing integrated support, 
enhanced ﬁnancial services, and strengthened GBV prevention.  
 
Project Background and Context  
Persons living with disabilities (PLWDs) often face signiﬁcant barriers to social and economic inclusion, compounded by limited access to education, healthcare, 
employment, and social support. Women with disabilities, in particular, experience intersectin g forms of discrimination and marginalization.  
Recognizing these challenges, the UN Women- supported project  through NHF  executed 
by Debbie Kauna Foundation (DKF)  aimed to enhance the livelihoods of PLWDs 
predominantly women, through mentorship programs combined with vocational training 
across carefully selected value chains suited to local economic contexts. The project 
sought not only to provide skills and resour ces but also to foster community acceptance 
and participation.  
3 
 
Target areas included Michika, Madagali, and adjacent communities, which are affected 
by displacement, returnee dynamics, and socio -economic challenges. Key value chains 
supported under the project encompassed agriculture (such as Small Ruminants, 
Poultry,  Rice Processing) and artisanal crafts (Tailoring, Shoe Making, Tie & Dye). 
Furthermore, the project ensured provision of assistive devices to improve participant mobility and productivity.  
The evaluation was designed to assess the effect of these multi -pronged interventions on 
the participants’ capacities, income generation, social standing, awareness of rights and 
safety, and overall quality of life.  
 
Evaluation Objectives and Scope  
The evaluation was guided by the following speciﬁc objectives:  
• To measure the effectiveness and quality of mentorship delivered, and its role in improving participant business knowledge and conﬁdence.  
• To assess the level and nature of participant engagement in the supported value chains and corresponding business growth strategies.  
• To evaluate ﬁnancial inclusion indicators, including access to formal banking, cooperative membership, and credit uptake.  
• To examine digital literacy levels and device access among participants, and the impact on their business promotion and connectivity.  
• To understand the extent of gender -based violence (GBV) awareness, availability 
of reporting mechanisms, and access to survivor support.  
• To capture participant perceptions of changes in their social integration, security, comfort, and overall well -being.  
• To identify challenges encountered during implementation and derive lessons for improved future programming.  
 
The scope concentrated mainly on 256 sampled individuals drawn from the total project 
target in the geographic areas, ensuring diversity in age, education, disability type, and 
residency status to represent the broader project population.

Methodology  
This evaluation combined quantitative surveys and qualitative focus group discussions 
(FGDs) to obtain a rich, multi -dimensional understanding of project outcomes.  
 
Data Collection:  
• Quantitative:  A structured questionnaire administered to 256 participants 
collected data on demographics, business involvement, mentorship experience, ﬁnancial and digital inclusion, GBV knowledge, and well -being. Data were 
disaggregated by gender, age category, type of disability, and location.  
• Qualitative:  FGDs involving groups of participants explored detailed experiences 
with mentors, business challenges, personal growth journeys, and community interactions.  
• Sampling:  Stratiﬁed sampling ensured representation of different clusters and 
community types (host, returnees, IDPs).  
Data Analysis:  
• Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (percentages, frequencies) and cross -tabulations for sub -group insights.  
• Qualitative narratives were thematically coded to align with evaluation objectives 
and to deepen contextual understanding.  
Ethical Considerations:  
Participation was voluntary with informed consent. Data conﬁdentiality and anonymity were strictly maintained, especially considering the sensitive nature of disability and 
GBV topics.

Key Findings  
Impact of Mentorship  
Mentorship was a cornerstone of success in this project. Participants highlighted 
mentors' approachability, patience, responsiveness, and delivery of practical 
knowledge. Mentors not only taught business management but also provided tailored advice on anim al care, product quality, risk mitigation, and community 
relations.   
Approximately 90% of participants conﬁrmed mentorship helped them build conﬁdence and 
improve business management skills. Many aspire 
to become mentors themselves, offering a sustainable, peer -led model for future 
development.  
Participants expressed heartfelt appreciation for Debbie Kauna Foundation, NHF , and  UN Women , 
underscoring the importance of projects that recognize and support persons with disabilities.

Vocational Training and Value Chain Engagement  
The project’s focus on training aligned closely with participants’ local realities.  
• Animal Husbandry : Beneﬁciaries reported plans to increase female 
livestock for herd multiplication, with attention to feeding, hygiene, and 
veterinary services. Cooperative formation and digital marketing were also 
planned.  
• Tailoring, Shoe Making, Tie & Dye : Participants showed enthusiasm 
for improving their craft, seeking advanced styles and better facilities like 
sewing machines and worktables.  
• Small Ruminants & Rice Processing : Provided 
additional earnings but faced constraints due to limited 
capital and equipment.  
Participants emphasized combining technical skills with 
sound business practices as key to sustained growth.

Financial Inclusion and Economic Empowerment  
Financial access remains mixed:  
• About 60% possess bank accounts, and roughly half are active in 
cooperatives.  
• Loan uptake remains low, due to repayment fears and collateral barriers.  
• Capital needs focus on bulk buying of feed, equipment procurement, and 
infrastructure.  
Bridging these ﬁnance gaps is essential to unlock full business potential.   
 
Figure 9: Financial Inclusion and Loan Uptake Chart  
Digital Literacy and Access to Technology  
Digital literacy efforts engaged about 65% of participants, but access to devices is uneven, limiting digital platform use for marketing or learning. Facebook and 
WhatsApp were the most popular platforms.  
Improved technology access and skills could 
further enhance market engagement and peer 
networking.

Gender -Based Violence (GBV) Awareness and Support  
GBV awareness varied, with many lacking training or knowledge of laws and 
reporting tools. Some participants reported violence or discrimination, indicating 
vulnerabilities that livelihood support alone cannot address.  
Increased GBV prevention training and survivor 
referral systems are needed for holistic protection.

Participant Well -Being and Social Integration  
Most participants report improved well -being, ﬁnding greater security and 
acceptance in their communities thanks to economic empowerment and social 
inclusion efforts.  
Self -conﬁdence, income independence, and reduced stigma are signiﬁcant 
impact results.

Challenges and Lessons Learned from Implementation  
While the project achieved many positive outcomes, the evaluation revealed a range of 
persistent challenges that impact the scalability, sustainability, and overall effectiveness 
of the interventions. Reﬂecting on these challenges alongside lessons learne d is crucial 
to inform future program design and implementation.  
Key points include:  
Limited Access to Capital and Financial Resources  
A recurring theme among participants was inadequate access to affordable capital, which restricted their ability to expand businesses, purchase inputs in bulk, and invest in 
necessary tools & infrastructure. Many beneﬁciaries highlighted the difficulty in obtaining 
loans due to the lack of collateral, fear of repayment, and limited availability of 
microﬁnance options tailored for persons with disabilities. This ﬁnancial gap posed a 
signiﬁca nt barrier to growth despite the participants’ motivation and sk ills. 
Lesson learned:  
Sustainable economic empowerment requires not only skills development but also 
facilitated access to ﬂexible, accessible ﬁnancial services, such as microcredit, grants, 
or revolving funds, designed with the unique needs of PLWDs in mind. Additionally, cooperative formations showed promise as a pathway for collective ﬁnancial strength 
and risk -sharing.  
 
Inadequate Access to Tools, Equipment, and Assistive Technology  
Many vocations, especially Tailoring and Shoe Making, demand quality equipment to improve efficiency and product quality. Participants frequently expressed frustration over 
the lack of reliable sewing machines, shoe polishing devices, and workspace 
enhance ments such as large cutting tables and power sources (e.g., generators). 
Assistive devices, while provided to some extent, were not always sufficient or promptly 
distributed to fully enable participant mobility and productivity.  
Lesson learned:  
Provision of adequate tools and assistive products must be timely, tailored, and scaled 
according to participant cluster needs. Follow- up maintenance and technical support 
for equipment is equally critical to sustain beneﬁts.  
 
  
11 
 
Gaps in Access to Veterinary and Animal Health Services  
Livestock -related value chains were dominant among participants, and good animal 
health is fundamental for productivity. However, participants highlighted limited 
veterinary facilities, inadequate access to vaccines and medicines, and poor availability 
of quality feed. This constrained livestock health and growth, increasing vulnerability to 
animal diseases and losses.  
Lesson learned:  
Building stronger linkages with local veterinary services, establishing mobile health 
clinics, and improving supply chains for feed and medicines are crucial steps to 
reinforce this value chain’s viability.  
 
Digital Divide and Limited Technology Access  
Although a sizeable portion of participants attended digital literacy classes, digital 
inclusion was hampered by uneven access to devices, limited comfort navigating digital 
platforms, and intermittent power or connectivity issues. This divide curtailed participants’ ability to leverage social media for marketing, explore e -commerce 
opportunities, or engage in peer learning remotely.  
Lesson learned:  
Bridging the digital divide necessitates greater investment in device provision tailored for PLWDs, accessible training methods (considering literacy levels and disabilities), 
and exploring low-tech or offline solutions coupled with community digital hubs.  
 
Insufficient Integration of Gender -Based Violence (GBV) Prevention and 
Response  
The evaluation uncovered gaps in GBV awareness, particularly around legal knowledge, reporting mechanisms, and survivor support options. Some participants disclosed 
experiences of discrimination and violence, but training and referral mechanisms were not c onsistently available or known.  
Lesson learned:  
Mainstreaming GBV prevention across all project components is imperative to 
safeguard participants. Livelihood programs must incorporate comprehensive 
sensitization, survivor support, and linkages with community and health services.  
 
  
12 
 
Sustainability and Dependency Concerns  
While mentorship fostered enthusiasm and capacity building, many participants 
expressed dependency on the project’s direct support for tools, inputs, and capital. 
Without sustainable mechanisms for continued training, ﬁnancial access, and 
mentorship, gains risk erosion after project closeout.  
Lesson learned:  
Cultivating local ownership through peer -led mentorship networks, embedding 
vocational support within local institutions or cooperatives, and identifying longer -term 
funding pathways increase the likelihood of sustained impact.
